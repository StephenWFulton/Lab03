			<h3>From Wikipedia:</h3>
			<p>Hobbes is seen in two differentiating perspectives. Calvin perceives him as a live tiger and a best friend. To everybody else, he's a stuffed tiger.</p>

			<p>	Hobbes is often shown to be smarter and wiser than Calvin when he is perceived as a real tiger. He is seen reading more often than his owner and tries to be the voice of reason when Calvin tries to perform a risky stunt or engage in a dubious scheme. Hobbes' advice mostly has no effect on Calvin, who usually ignores Hobbes's reasoning and winds up getting in trouble for his actions. Because of this, some fans say that Hobbes represents Calvin's conscience. However, Hobbes is shown to be terrible at math, quite possibly worse than Calvin himself.</p>

			<p>	Hobbes is named after Thomas Hobbes, a philosopher who at times had a poor outlook on life and human nature. When Hobbes is shown to be alive, he is proud of his species and glad not to be a human, showing that when Hobbes comes to life, he too believes he is a real tiger.</p>
